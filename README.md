# PDF Manager Project

## Overview 

Since I can't find a good way to organize my pdfs and research notes, I plan on creating my own solution. Planned features include:

* File management
	* All pdfs should be renamed by article DOI or book ISBN
	* Each article or book should have bibtex reference file
	* PDFs, bib reference, and notes should be kept together in a folder
	* Tags and categories should be able to be assigned to pdfs
* Visual
	* UI showing pdfs in folder
		* Sort by title, tags, categories, etc.
	* Maybe convert markdown notes to html and host on server?
* Scripts
	* Scrape DOI
		* rename file by DOI and move to folder with same DOI
	* DL BibTeX from DOI
	* Create markdown file for my notes each time a new pdf is added
